<!--
  index.html - The Single HTML File
  ==================================
  This is the ONLY HTML file in a React single-page application (SPA).

  HOW REACT WORKS WITH THIS FILE:
  ==============================
  1. Browser loads this HTML file
  2. Browser sees the <script> tag and loads main.tsx
  3. React runs and renders your entire app INTO the <div id="root">
  4. From then on, React handles all UI updates (no page reloads!)

  This is why it's called a "Single Page Application" - there's literally
  just this one HTML page, and JavaScript handles everything else.

  VITE'S ROLE:
  ============
  During development, Vite serves this file and handles:
  - Hot Module Replacement (instant updates without refresh)
  - TypeScript/JSX compilation on the fly
  - Importing CSS, images, and other assets

  For production, Vite builds optimized bundles and updates the script tags.

<!doctype html>
<!--
  DOCTYPE Declaration
  ===================
  Tells the browser "this is an HTML5 document."
  Without it, browsers might render in "quirks mode" (legacy compatibility).
  Always include this as the first line of any HTML file.
-->

<html lang="en">
<!--
  <html> Root Element
  ===================
  The root element of the page. All other elements are inside this.

  lang="en" - Declares the page language as English.
  This helps:
    - Screen readers pronounce text correctly
    - Search engines understand the content
    - Browsers offer translation when appropriate
-->

  <head>
    <!--
      <head> Section - Metadata
      =========================
      Contains information ABOUT the page (not visible content).
      Includes: character encoding, title, stylesheets, meta tags, etc.
    -->

    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <!--
      Character Encoding
      ==================
      UTF-8 supports virtually all characters from all languages.
      Without this, special characters (é, ñ, 日本語) might display incorrectly.
      Always include this and make it the FIRST meta tag.
    -->

    <link rel="icon" type="image/svg+xml" href="/vite.svg" />
    <!--
      Favicon (Browser Tab Icon)
      ==========================
      The small icon shown in browser tabs and bookmarks.
      - rel="icon" - This link is a favicon
      - type="image/svg+xml" - It's an SVG file (modern, scalable)
      - href="/vite.svg" - Located in the /public folder

      You can replace this with your own D&D-themed icon!
    -->

    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <!--
      Viewport Meta Tag (CRITICAL for mobile)
      =======================================
      Tells mobile browsers how to handle the page width.

      width=device-width: Page width = device screen width
      initial-scale=1.0: Start at 100% zoom (no zooming out to fit)

      Without this, mobile browsers assume the page is ~980px wide
      (designed for desktop) and zoom out to fit, making text tiny!
    -->

    <title>dnd-application</title>
    <!--
      Page Title
      ==========
      Shown in:
        - Browser tab
        - Browser history
        - Search engine results
        - Bookmarks

      Keep it concise but descriptive. You might change this to
      "D&D Adventure | Character Tracker" or similar.

  </head>

  <body>
    <!--
      <body> Section - Visible Content
      =================================
      Everything the user sees goes here.
      In a React app, there's usually just one element...
    -->

    <div id="root"></div>
    <!--
      React Mount Point
      =================
      THIS IS WHERE REACT LIVES!

      React's createRoot() function (in main.tsx) finds this div
      and renders your entire application inside it.

      The id="root" is a convention, but you could name it anything
      as long as main.tsx looks for the same ID.

      After React renders, this div will contain your full app:
        <div id="root">
          <div class="app">
            <header>...</header>
            <main>...</main>
          </div>
        </div>
    -->

    <script type="module" src="/src/main.tsx"></script>
    <!--
      Application Entry Point
      =======================
      This loads and runs your React application.

      type="module" - Use ES6 modules (import/export syntax)
                      Also makes the script "defer" by default
                      (waits for HTML to parse before running)

      src="/src/main.tsx" - The entry point TypeScript file
                            Vite compiles this on the fly during development

      LEARNING POINT:
      In traditional HTML, you'd have many <script> tags for each JS file.
      With modern bundlers like Vite, you have ONE entry point that
      imports everything else. Vite handles all the bundling!
